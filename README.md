# ScreeningAutomation
Summary:
Uses a Fitnesse Wiki Table to populate global vars and run Selenium WebDriver (Java) tests.
Requires an initial run to grab (good) baseline website screen captures to compare subsequent website screen captures.
Baseline images are stored in the user's C:\baseline directory.
Current images and respective diffs are stored in C:\current\<timestamp> directory.

Uses the following techs:
* Selenium WebDriver (Java)
* Fitnesse
* Sikuli (currently not implemented)
